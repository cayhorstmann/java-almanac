title: Java 8

{{< jdkdetails "8" >}}

Java 8 finally added *lambda* syntax and *method references* as a modern language
constructs. The main application within the JDK API is the new `java.util.streams`
package. A initial set of common functional interfaces is shipped in the new
package `java.util.function`.

The extremely useful [Joda-Time](https://www.joda.org/joda-time/) library has been
integrated into the JDK as a new package `java.time`. Instead of the mostly deprecated
`java.util.Date` and `java.util.Calendar` classes we now have a modern and powerful API
for calculations with dates and times.
